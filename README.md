# Snowduno
Custom Arduino Board in Snow Shape.

Snowduno is make to celebrate the upcoming **Christmas Event**.

Snowduno is a microcontroller that base on Atmel328-AU and work as Arduino-Pro-Mini.It has 14 digital pins and 8 analog pins.
Snowduno was inspired by Arduino Lilypad that has the flower shape but Snowduno has the shape of snow.

## Images
For this project **(Snowduno)** I have a problem with the 3D view about board edge layer, so I can't show the 3D image of it.
But here some images from the design:

The Back Layer.

# Support
[EasyEDA](http://EasyEDA.com) is the easy way to design your PCB and the cool thing is you can design your PCB online, no need to download it :laughing:.
For this project I used **KiCad** to design it but I can import all my file to [EasyEDA](http://EasyEDA.com) and I can edit it even when I don't have my computer around.

For produce the **Snowduno** I choose [JLCPCB](http://JLCPCB.com) as the supplier because I always use **JLCPCB** since my first design.
If you want to make any PCB I recommend using  [JLCPCB](http://JLCPCB.com) since it easy to use and has a cheap price, best for Prototype PCB.

# Issues
As mention above I have a problem with board edge layer and I can't view it as 3D image but I think it's not the big problem.
When I use **Gerber Viewer** everything seem ok to me.

# Noticed
The **Snowduno** will be produce soon on [JLCPCB](http://JLCPCB.com). 
I will update if anything change when the I finished making **Snowduno**. :smile:

**Marry Christmas** everyone.
