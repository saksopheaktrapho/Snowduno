# Snowduno
Custom Arduino Board in Snow Shape 

Snowduno is a microcontroller that base on Atmel328-AU and work as Arduino-Pro-Mini.It has 14 digital pins and 8 analog pins.
Snowduno was inspired by Arduino Lilypad that has the flower shape but Snowduno has the shape of snow.

[EasyEDA](http://EasyEDA.com) is the easy way to design your PCB and the cool thing is you can design your PCB online, no need to download it XD.
For this project I used **KiCad** to design it but I can import all my file to [EasyEDA](http://EasyEDA.com) and I can edit it even when I don't have my computer around.

For produce the **Snowduno** I choose [JLCPCB](http://JLCPCB.com) as the supplier because I always use **JLCPCB** since my first design.
If you want to make any PCB I recommend using  [JLCPCB](http://JLCPCB.com) since it easy to use and has a cheap price, best for Prototype PCB.
